    <h2>Development of a runtime measurement system</h2>

    <p>I am developing a system designed to accurately measure and analyze runtime of various software or hardware
        processes. The idea for this system arose from the need for precise timing and measurement solutions within the
        context of embedded systems development.</p>

    <p>Software Based measurements are popular and easy to realize. Though change the system under test since you add
        measurement code. Accuracy is limited and dependent on the speed the embedded system is clocked and the overhead
        introduced by the software-defined runtime measurement.<br>
        Resulting in massively changing the time behaviour of the system. To reduce the intrusiveness, changing the
        measurement methodology using external hardware can be useful.
    </p>

    <h2>Let's take a look at the development process. Our Use Case.</h2>
    <p>Our developed system (System A) handles two distinct events: Event A (entering) and Event B (exiting).</p>
    <div class="svg-container">
        <object type="text/html" data="svgs/systema.html" width="1000" height="200"></object>
    </div>

    <p>These events are represented by rising and falling edges on a digital signal line. The time interval between
        these two events (t<sub>B</sub>-t<sub>A</sub>) represents the runtime of the process we want to measure.</p>

    <div class="svg-container">
        <object type="text/html" data="svgs/systema_base.html" width="1000" height="350"></object>
    </div>
    <p>Since our system must fulfill specific timing requirements, t<sub>B</sub>-t<sub>A</sub> must be within the
        maximum allowed time
        constraints. Therefore we add the green line Δt<sub>max_allowed</sub>. </p>
    <div class="svg-container">
        <object type="text/html" data="svgs/systema_base_tmax.html" width="1000" height="300"></object>
    </div>

    <p>When we look into our system, the system consists of two modules. Module 1 is responsible for processing input
        data, while Module 2 handles output data. Our System A fulfills the requirement. Therefore we release this
        system with version 1.0.</p>

    <div class="svg-container">
        <object type="text/html" data="svgs/systema_module.html" width="1000" height="300"></object>
    </div>

    <p>Let’s assume a fictitious customer requests a new feature for our system. Leading to a third module being added
        to the system. After a few months the Module 3 is almost completed and integrated into the system. Integration
        tests can finally be performed to ensure that the new module works correctly with the existing modules.</p>
    <div class="svg-container">
        <object type="text/html" data="svgs/systema_module3.html" width="900" height="300"></object>
    </div>

    <p>After integrating Module 3, we observe that the runtime (t<sub>B</sub>-t<sub>A</sub>) has increased and now
        exceeds the maximum
        allowed time constraint (Δt<sub>max_allowed</sub>). This indicates that the addition of Module 3 has negatively
        impacted
        the system's performance, leading to a violation of the timing requirements.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>Conclusion - Our Development Process</h3>
    <p>Now we got a better understanding of the engineering perspective. But to really understand the full problem, we
        have to have a look into the development workflow we used above. The order of events is crucial in identifying
        when and where the timing violations occur.</p>

    <h2>Development Workflow with Runtime Analysis (Only Before Release)</h2>
    <div class="svg-container">
        <object type="text/html" data="svgs/workflow_before.html" width="700" height="300"></object>
    </div>

<h3>Summarize</h3>
<p>This case clearly demonstrates the critical importance of early and continuous runtime monitoring. We´ve realized: By integrating automated measurements from the start of development, we can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Detect timing violations immediately, not just before release</li>
    <li>Prevent costly late-stage fixes</li>
    <li>Track performance trends throughout development</li>
    <li>Substitute our one-shot measurements directly before our release as they provide only one data point, but do not offer insights into performance trends over time or under varying conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than discovering issues at release time, systematic measurements during each development phase allow us to maintain control over system timing constraints.</p>
<p>The summary was easy I guess. So lets continue with the proposed workflow we have in mind now. Which is even more obvious for the development of our system. </p>

<h2>Proposed Development Workflow with Runtime Analysis (During Development)</h2>
    <div class="svg-container">
        <object type="text/html" data="svgs/workflow_proposed.html" width="700" height="300"></object>
    </div>

<p>At first glance, this solution might seem obvious or straightforward. You might think: "I could have thought of that." However, the real challenge lies in implementing and maintaining such a systematic approach throughout development.</p>

    <h2>System Resolution</h2>

    <p>Resolution and accuracy depends on the clocking speed of the system. What is our accuracy if we use an oscillator
        with frequency f?</p>

    <p>This means with a clocking oscillator of 100 MHz we can measure time events with a resolution of 10 ns.<br>
        Resolution: the smallest time increment you can distinguish (determined by clock period)<br>
        Accuracy: how close your measurement is to the true value (affected by clock stability, jitter, calibration,
        etc.)</p>

    <h2>PS:</h2>


    <p>Another driving factor for developing this system was personal interest. I'm fascinated by embedded hardware, but
        my prior work was always focused on one goal: Writing and running software on it. Though that often meant an
        odyssey through compiler issues and hardware reference manuals!</p>

    <p>My long-term aspiration has been to get even closer to the metal, and that's where FPGAs come in. This is the
        perfect intersection: I can realize the high-precision runtime measurement feature using an FPGA. Not only are
        FPGAs inherently fast due to their independence from a main CPU, but the project also gives me a valuable
        opportunity to learn new skills.</p>
