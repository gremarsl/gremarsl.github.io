    <h1>Welcome to my little, basic website!</h1>
    <p>
      I created this page to help me & you explore and compare different scenarios for renting or buying property.
      With simple calculators and easy-to-read charts, you can see how things like inflation, rent increases, and salary growth might affect your decisions over time.

      I hope you find it helpful!
